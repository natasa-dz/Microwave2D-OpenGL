## Features  
1. **Door with Semi-Transparent Glass:**  
   - Doors can be opened (`O`) and closed (`Z`) interactively.  
   - Glass transparency can be toggled.  

2. **Realistic Lighting:**  
   - A round lamp illuminates the food inside while the microwave is running.  
   - Dynamic lighting effects simulate real-life visuals.  

3. **Numerical Keypad and Timer:**  
   - Clickable keypad to set the timer (format: MM:SS).  
   - Timer decrements in real-time, stopping at zero.  

4. **Control Buttons:**  
   - **Start:** Begins microwave operation.  
   - **Stop:** Pauses the operation.  
   - **Reset:** Resets the timer and lamp.  

5. **Operational Constraints:**  
   - Microwave halts when the door opens and cannot start unless closed.  
   - Microwave will not start if the timer is zero.  

6. **Completion Indicator:**  
   - An external lamp blinks when the timer reaches zero.  

7. **Malfunction Simulation (X Key):**  
   - Gradual scene darkening.  
   - Animated smoke rising and dissipating.  
   - Timer displays `ERROR` and blinks.  
   - Microwave becomes non-operational.  

8. **Servicing Mode:**  
   - Reactivates microwave, removes smoke, and resets the scene to its original state.  

9. **Credits Display:**  
   - Authorâ€™s name, surname, and student ID are shown in a corner of the screen.
